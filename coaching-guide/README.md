## Roles

### Tech Lead

The Tech Lead has overall responsibility for technical preparation. This includes providing technical set-up and escalation support, ensuring quality execution of the engagement and customer experience, and gathering feedback from coaches. Tech Leads should have strong leadership qualities and a demonstrated ability to drive results. Tech Leads should have already coached in the topic selected for the hackathon engagement. Your high-level responsibilities include:

- Assisting the Project Lead
- Validating that Coaches are prepared
- Providing technical set-up and escalation support
- Ensuring quality execution of the engagement and customer experience
- Gathering feedback from Coaches and participants (both technical and programmatic)

### Coach

Coaches are responsible for observing the participants assigned to a breakout group. The size *should be* fewer than 10 attendees, fostering an environment of collaboration and simplifying the delegation of tasks. The breakout group must work together on the *same challenge* before they can move on to the next. It is your job as coach to ensure they stay on task, individual members don't jump ahead to the next challenge(s). You can move the team to the next challenge when you believe they successfully fulfilled the current challenge's requirements.

You are not there to give answers to challenges. Since hackathons are "open" by nature, teams are free to meet the challenge objectives in any way they choose. They are not bound to predetermined technologies, except for one or two exceptions. This means, as a coach, you make a judgment call when the team asks you to evaluate their solution. You are not there to provide answers to challenges. The coach's guide will have possible solutions and examples of potential pitfalls. If the team is stuck and wasting too much time going down the wrong path, you may ask them clarifying questions to challenge their approach and help them think through or rationalize their decisions. If you are unable to help the team, reach out to the Tech Lead for assistance.

Finally, each hackathon has a minimum number of challenges attendees must successfully complete to gain credit for completing the hack. Students should not be told which challenge is the last one they need to pass to achieve this goal. The challenges that follow are considered stretch goals. Teams will move at their own pace. There is not a set amount of time required for each challenge. Let them move at their own pace, but if it appears as though they will not complete enough challenges in time to gain credit, you may choose to prod them along and warn them that they are at risk of not completing the hack objectives.

## Coach materials

Review the coach materials within the [hackathon-guides](../hackathon-guides) directory. Each hackathon has a coach's guide that contains the following:

- Hackathon agenda
- Learning goals
- Challenge descriptions
- Challenge solutions
- Challenge solution architecture
- Technical resources
